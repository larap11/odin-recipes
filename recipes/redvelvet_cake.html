        <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>3/4 cup light olive oil or vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup low-fat buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 tsp white distilled vinegar</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp red gel food coloring</li>
      
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350˚F with racks in the center of the oven. Grease two 9-inch round cake pans with butter and dust with flour, tapping out the excess.</li>
        <li>Stir then sift together 2 1/2 cups flour, 2 Tbsp cocoa powder, 1 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp salt.</li>
        <li>In a bowl with an electric mixer, beat together 1/2 cup softened butter and 1 1/2 cups sugar for a few minutes until sugar is moistened and the mixture looks powdery like snow. </li>
        <li>Mix in two eggs, adding them one a time, and beating well to incorporate between each addition. Beat in 2 tsp vanilla extract until blended.</li>
        <li>With the mixer on, gradually add 3/4 cup oil and mix on medium speed until well incorporated.</li>
        <li>Stir 1 tsp vinegar into your buttermilk then mix it into the batter on medium speed until incorporated. </li>
        <li>Add flour mixture all at once and mix on medium speed just until well blended and no streaks of flour remain, scraping down the bowl as needed. </li>
        <li>Add 1/2 tsp gel red food coloring or add it to reach desired color and mix just until blended, scraping down the bowl as needed.</li>
        <li>Divide evenly between prepared pans and bake at 350˚F for 30 minutes. Let rest in cake pans for 20 minutes then invert onto a wire rack and let cool completely to room temp before assembling with Cream Cheese Frosting.</li>
    </ol>
