    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>225g unsalted butter, softened, plus extra for greasing</li>
    <li>225g caster sugar</li>
    <li>4 medium free-range eggs</li>
    <li>175g self-raising flour</li>
    <li>50g cocoa powder</li>
    <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
    <li>2-3 tbsp milk</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C/fan160°C/gas 4. Grease 2 x 20cm sandwich tins with a little butter and base line with baking paper. In a bowl, beat together the butter and sugar with an electric hand whisk until light and fluffy.</li>
    <li> Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating after each addition. Sift in the flour, baking powder and cocoa, then lightly fold into the mixture.</li>
    <li>Add a little milk until you have a dropping consistency, then divide between the tins. It’s best to only fill the sandwich tins 3/4 full.</li>
    <li>Bake for 20-25 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Leave to cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    <li>Melt the chocolate in a bowl over a pan of simmering water, then cool slightly. In a bowl, beat the butter and icing sugar together with an electric hand whisk until light and fluffy, then fold in the melted chocolate.</li>
    <li>Spread some icing over 1 of the cakes, top with the other cake and the rest of the icing.</li>
</ol>
